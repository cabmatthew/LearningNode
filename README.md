Within LearningNode, CD to ./FirstServer:
```
cd FirstServer
```
Install Express & EJS templates:
```
npm i ejs express
```
Run the code:
```
node expressApp.js
```
Now your server should be running! You can type in the URL 'localhost:3000' in any browser to see the server's HTML responses.

Note: VSCode needs 'EJS language support' before it can recognize EJS.
